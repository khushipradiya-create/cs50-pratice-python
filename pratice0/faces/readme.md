# Faces

This program converts text-based emoticons into emoji.

Before emoji existed, people used emoticons like :) to represent a happy face and :( to represent a sad face. This program automatically replaces those emoticons with their corresponding emoji.



Accepts a string as input.

# Replaces:

:) with 🙂 (slightly smiling face)

:( with 🙁 (slightly frowning face)

Returns the modified string.

All other text remains unchanged.
