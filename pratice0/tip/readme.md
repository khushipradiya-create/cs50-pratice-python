# Tip Calculator

This program calculates how much tip to leave based on the cost of a meal and a desired tip percentage.

The user is prompted to enter the meal cost in dollars and the tip percentage. The program then calculates and displays the correct tip amount, formatted to two decimal places.

# How It Works

The program includes three functions:

# dollars_to_float(d)

Takes a string representing a dollar amount (e.g., $50.00).

Removes the dollar sign and converts the value to a float.

# percent_to_float(p)

Takes a string representing a percentage (e.g., 15%).

Removes the percent sign and converts the value to a decimal.

# call main()

Prompts the user for the meal cost and tip percentage.

# Calculates the tip.

Prints the tip amount formatted to two decimal places.
