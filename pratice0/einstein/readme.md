# Einstein

This program calculates the equivalent energy of a given mass using Albert Einstein’s famous equation:

E=mc2

# where:

E represents energy in Joules

m represents mass in kilograms

c represents the speed of light (300,000,000 meters per second)

# How It Works

The program:

Prompts the user to enter a mass (as an integer, in kilograms).
Calculates the energy using the formula 
E=m×c2


Outputs the result as an integer representing Joules.
